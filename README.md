# MLH Unity Workshop Project

![](/Notes/img/screenshot.png)

Download this [Starter Pack Package File](/Notes/MLH%20Starter%20Pack.unitypackage) and import it into an empty Unity project. It includes all required files like textures and animations except C# scripts and animator controllers. These were created during the workshop.

Read the [Workshop Notes](/Notes/MLH%20Local%20Hack%20Day%20December%202017%20-%20Unity%20Workshop%20Notes.pdf) to see what was covered. It also includes every single script which was written (fully commented as well).

If you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue](../../issues/new) with a relevant question.

Happy coding!
